# LnkSerialization

Project to serialize/deserialize shortcut links as a human-friendly editable/readable json collection.

In my daily chores, I use the Win+R shortcuts **a lot** to access network folders, desktop, download or my different applications.

Sometimes I need to change my shortcuts in batches:

- A network path changes > multiple shortcuts are affected
- I want to programatically add new folders (e.g.: new project folders)
- I want to share my changes with other users: It is true that I can correctly create the shortcut with shortcuts as `%userProfile%`, but creating the shortcuts this way, takes longer.
- Update the binaries path of a tool that changes its folder. e.g.: `\App_v1\bin.exe\` to `\App_v2\bin.exe`.
- Others

My setup is the following:

1. Have a folder (`C:\shortcuts\`) with your links. (I have provided a `example.json` with some links. A deserialization is required. See below.)
2. Add that folder to your Windows `Path` Environment Variables. (possible via `pathman /au c:\shortcuts`).
3. Usage: In that folder, a `dl.lnk` shortcut to my `Downloads` folder exists.
4. Whenever I need to access the Downloads folder, I do a `Win+R` and run `dl`.
5. Voil√†!

With this tool, the shortcuts can be serialized as a `.json` file.\
This file can be easily edited and shared.\
You can call your favorite tools and folders without navigating on your file explorer.

## Tool usage

To serialize a shortcuts folder to a .json file:

```
LnkSerialization serialize -i "Path\To\Shortcuts" -o "Path\To\backup.json"
```

To deserialize a .json file to a shortcuts folder:

```
LnkSerialization deserialize -i "Path\To\backup.json" -o "Path\To\backup.json" "Path\To\Shortcuts"
```

The repo comes with an `example.json` file with some starting links.
